2. Get a temperature thing going.
2.1. Add renormalization - right now the energy explodes if there is any attraction.
3. Get an ideal gas law like prediction.
4. Get collisions going.
5. Get some kind of a van der waal's equation prediction / a, b calculator.
6. Add a size for the particles.
7. When you go off the page and come back it usually is completely broken - everything's in the corners and whatnot. Probably something with intervals being funky.

1. Write a bit of a description to turn it into an article about Van der Waal's equation for pressure in a closed system.

1. Make it work better with resizing.
1. Make it only the one that is on the screen play.



1. Make some other kind of particle simulation.s
1. The London dispersion forces (also called Van der Waal's forces?) would be a super simple one to model. I think that I just need two atoms with positively charged nuclei and orbiting electrons, and then I can show that they are naturally attracted to each other because of the 1/r^2 law.
1. Ultimately, I think it would be sick if I could naturally get some phase changes going. Ideally I could do liquid/vapor equilibrium using only simple rules for when molecules are attracted to each other and when they repel each other. Also would be cool to be able to do solids? Although I'm not really sure how that would work, I think I would just need to set them up to be covalently bonded to each other. What makes ice when you remove heat? It must just be some kind of reconfiguration of the particles.
1. I was wanting to model heat on a bunch of particles by allowing you to click, and near where you were clicking the particles would speed up.
