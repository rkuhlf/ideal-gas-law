1. Fix the problem with the pressure-per-side.

1. Clean up the graphs.
    - Add all o fthe ones I'm supposed to have.
1. Clean up the CSS (overall layout).
    - The inputs should go beside the canvas, the graphs below or also to the side.
1. Clean up the writing.
1. Make everything mathJax.

## Other Sims
1. Rename to particle sims so that I can make some more pages and reuse the same infrastructure when I build other similar sims.

1. The London dispersion forces (also called Van der Waal's forces?) would be a super simple one to model. I think that I just need two atoms with positively charged nuclei and orbiting electrons, and then I can show that they are naturally attracted to each other because of the 1/r^2 law.
1. Ultimately, I think it would be sick if I could naturally get some phase changes going. Ideally I could do liquid/vapor equilibrium using only simple rules for when molecules are attracted to each other and when they repel each other. Also would be cool to be able to do solids? Although I'm not really sure how that would work, I think I would just need to set them up to be covalently bonded to each other. What makes ice when you remove heat? It must just be some kind of reconfiguration of the particles.
1. I was wanting to model heat on a bunch of particles by allowing you to click, and near where you were clicking the particles would speed up.


### Do Van Der Waal's Equation
4. Get collisions going.
5. Get some kind of a van der waal's equation prediction / a, b calculator.
6. Add a size for the particles.
